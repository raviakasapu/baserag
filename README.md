# LLM Evluation using Ragas and Langchain

Ragas is a framework that helps you evaluate an enterprise Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. 
Ragas is very easy to use and evaluate the RAG since there is no additional data required. The Context used in the RAG pipeline and  Question and Answers are used for evaluating the RAG.

Ragas can provide below metrics https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html

* Faithfulness
* Answer relevancy
* Context recall
* Context precision
* Context relevancy
* Context entity recall

We will use LangChain framework to implement the RAG and functions/chains provided within LangChain
